This is MLCraft, the Minecraft mod to make Miencraft more realistic. We base the world generation on elevation and biome maps generated from AI that are trained on real world biome data.

To start:

1. Clone repository
2. Add in the biome and elevation files from our AI generator into the run/config/mlcraft directory
3. Build Gradle
4. Under the Gradle section, under Tasks/Fabric, run the runClient build
5. Once Minecraft is running, select create new world, and the switch world preset to MLCraft generator
